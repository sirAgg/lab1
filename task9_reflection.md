# Reflection Lab 1
==================

- ####What did I learn? What did I already know?

    As I alredy have some experience with c++ and c so I didn't learn a lot.   
    But I learnt that std::cin can't really read in single characters so I had  
    to use scanf with a leading space: `scanf(" %c" &c);`

- ####What was difficult? 

    What I found tricky was reading in just one char from std:cin.   
    I solved this the 'lazy' way by just reading cin to a string and  
    just comparing to the first char in that string.   
    After reading one char from scanf i also had to clear stdin   
    before continuing to read in next answer.

    I thought that these task were very easy but as I have some experience  
    in c and c++ I'm not the right person to ask this question.

--------------------
In total I spent about 4-5 hours on this lab.
